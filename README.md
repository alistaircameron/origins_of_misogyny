Replication code and data for On the Origins of Misogyny

Most data sets used in this paper are created, annotated and edited by other authors in Stata. As such, we use Stata to extract that data. To do the same, run ‘data_extraction.do’. 

The data analysis is then conducted in R. After running data_extraction.do, open ‘the_origins_of_misogyny.do’.

Source files: for individual level data, we use the Integrated Values Survey (1981-2021) which is constructed from the EVS and WVS trend files. The IVS is freely available online at the following link, but is not ours to distribute, see: https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSNewsShow.jsp?ID=442. Similarly, we have downloaded many raw data files from other authors, and while these are all freely available online at the time of writing, are not ours to distribute.
