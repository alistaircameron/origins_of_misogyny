Replication code and data for On the Origins of Misogyny

Most data sets used in this paper are created, annotated and edited by other authors in Stata. As such, we use Stata to extract that data. To do the same, run ‘data_extraction.do’. 

The data analysis is then conducted in R. After running data_extraction.do, open ‘the_origins_of_misogyny.do’.
